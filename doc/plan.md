## Goal

Create a new project based on the following requirements:

UI & Layout Source:
Use the design and layout from
/Users/zackwu204/CursorAI/Sunique/02-Shipping/development-web.

Logic & Functionality Source:
Follow the logic and implementation from
/Users/zackwu204/CursorAI/Sunique/02-Shipping/development.

## Objective

Perform a minimal migration that focuses solely on updating the UI and design elements, while keeping all backend logic, Python scripts, and functional flow unchanged.
In other words, preserve all logic and only modernize the interface.
